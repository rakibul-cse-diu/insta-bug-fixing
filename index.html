            <h3>Q: How does JavaScript works?</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is an interpreted language that is run line by line.When you execute a JavaScript application
                within a browser, the code is received by the browser's engine, which then runs the source code to
                produce the result.The source code of a conventional JavaScript engine goes through numerous
                phases.</br>

                This is the engine's initial step; whenever we run a JavaScript application, our code is first received
                by the "parser" within the JS engine. The parser's role is to examine the JavaScript code line by line
                for syntactic problems.
                Once the parser has checked all JavaScript codes and determined that there are no problems, it builds
                the data structure known as AST, which is similar to a tree.
                Then the engine will strat to convert the code in to a machine code.
                After converting JS code to a machine code the engine will sent the code to the system for execution.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="qa">
            <h3>Q: What does JS event loop do?</h3>
            <p>When the call stack in the JavaScripts engine discovered an asynchronus function, the call stack
                transmitted that function to the web API. Then call stck, which will run the next function on the stack.
                When the web API completes the job of an asynchronous function, it sends it to the engine, and the
                engine executes that function when the web API finishes the work.
                Although JavaScript is single-threaded, the browser APIs operate as independent threads. This process is
                aided by the event loop, which continually checks to see if the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new
                functions from the event queue are added. If it isn't, the current function call is executed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="qa">
            <h3>Q: Difference between session storage and local storage.</h3>
            <p>When a document is loaded in a certain tab of the browser, a unique page session is established and
                allocated to that tab. That page session is only valid for that tab.  A page session lasts as long as
                the tab or browser is active and is unaffected by page reloads and restorations.  Unlike session
                cookies, opening a page in a new tab or window launches a new session with the value of the top-level
                browsing context. When you open several tabs/windows with the same URL, sessionStorage is created for
                each tab/window.LocalStorage has no expiration date, however sessionStorage data is removed when the
                page session expires  that is, when the page is closed. When the last "private" tab is closed,
                localStorage data for a page loaded in a "private browsing" or "incognito" session is removed.</p>
